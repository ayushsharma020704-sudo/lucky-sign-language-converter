# Lucky: The Sassy Sign Language Converter 🤟😎

> "I analyze your hands so you don't have to!" - Lucky

Welcome to **Lucky**, the world's most judgmental (but helpful) sign language translator! This project uses artificial intelligence to translate sign language gestures into text and speech in real-time, all while a virtual avatar reacts to your performance.

## 🌟 Features

*   **Real-Time Translation**: Uses TensorFlow.js and Handpose to detect gestures directly in your browser.
*   **Lucky's Mood Swing**: Lucky gets happy when you sign correctly, and confused/hangry when you don't.
*   **Sassy Text-to-Speech**: translated text is read aloud in voices like "Robot", "Alien", or "Grumpy".
*   **Gamified Experience**: A Mood Meter tracks your performance. Don't let Lucky get hangry!

*   **Slang Dictionary**: Discover the *real* meaning behind common gestures.
